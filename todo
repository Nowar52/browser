incorporate cp_certs and other tools in tls script via '

if ! command_exists cp_certs; then
  bash<(curl .....boss/deploy-script/cp_certs) $@
else
 cp_certs $@
fi

etc. And ensure that run_docker takes

PORT hostname and emailaddress and sets everything up in a single command, certs and all

also ensure we open port 80 on internal firewall first so we can get cert

ialso add the docker to release notes for 7.1.2 and also to news section of readme
